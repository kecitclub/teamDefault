# A long, long time ago, there was a clever crow named Kalu. He loved watching over the villagers, and whenever danger was near, he would caw loudly to warn them. One day, a big storm was coming, and Kalu flew around the village, shouting, "Caw! Caw! Protect your crops! A storm is coming!"
# The villagers listened to Kalu, saved their crops, and were very thankful. From that day on, people began to feed crows during Kaag Tihar to thank them for being the messengers of the gods.
